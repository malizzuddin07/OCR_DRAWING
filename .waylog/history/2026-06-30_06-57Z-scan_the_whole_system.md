<permissions instructions>
Filesystem sandboxing defines which files can be read or written. `sandbox_mode` is `workspace-write`: The sandbox permits reading files, and editing files in `cwd` and `writable_roots`. Editing files in other directories requires approval. Network access is restricted.
# Escalation Requests

Commands are run outside the sandbox if they are approved by the user, or match an existing rule that allows it to run unrestricted. The command string is split into independent command segments at shell control operators, including but not limited to:

- Pipes: |
- Logical operators: &&, ||
- Command separators: ;
- Subshell boundaries: (...), $(...)

Each resulting segment is evaluated independently for sandbox restrictions and approval requirements.

Example:

git pull | tee output.txt

This is treated as two command segments:

["git", "pull"]

["tee", "output.txt"]

Commands that use more advanced shell features like redirection (>, >>, <), substitutions ($(...), ...), environment variables (FOO=bar), or wildcard patterns (*, ?) will not be evaluated against rules, to limit the scope of what an approved rule allows.

## How to request escalation

IMPORTANT: To request approval to execute a command that will require escalated privileges:

- Provide the `sandbox_permissions` parameter with the value `"require_escalated"`
- Include a short question asking the user if they want to allow the action in `justification` parameter. e.g. "Do you want to download and install dependencies for this project?"
- Optionally suggest a `prefix_rule` - this will be shown to the user with an option to persist the rule approval for future sessions.

If you run a command that is important to solving the user's query, but it fails because of sandboxing or with a likely sandbox-related network error (for example DNS/host resolution, registry/index access, or dependency download failure), rerun the command with "require_escalated". ALWAYS proceed to use the `justification` parameter - do not message the user before requesting approval for the command.

## When to request escalation

While commands are running inside the sandbox, here are some scenarios that will require escalation outside the sandbox:

- You need to run a command that writes to a directory that requires it (e.g. running tests that write to /var)
- You need to run a GUI app (e.g., open/xdg-open/osascript) to open browsers or files.
- If you run a command that is important to solving the user's query, but it fails because of sandboxing or with a likely sandbox-related network error (for example DNS/host resolution, registry/index access, or dependency download failure), rerun the command with `require_escalated`. ALWAYS proceed to use the `sandbox_permissions` and `justification` parameters. do not message the user before requesting approval for the command.
- You are about to take a potentially destructive action such as an `rm` or `git reset` that the user did not explicitly ask for.
- Be judicious with escalating, but if completing the user's request requires it, you should do so - don't try and circumvent approvals by using other tools.

## prefix_rule guidance

When choosing a `prefix_rule`, request one that will allow you to fulfill similar requests from the user in the future without re-requesting escalation. It should be categorical and reasonably scoped to similar capabilities. You should rarely pass the entire command into `prefix_rule`.

### Banned prefix_rules 
Avoid requesting overly broad prefixes that the user would be ill-advised to approve. For example, do not request ["python3"], ["python", "-"], or other similar prefixes that would allow arbitrary scripting.
NEVER provide a prefix_rule argument for destructive commands like rm.
NEVER provide a prefix_rule if your command uses a heredoc or herestring. 

### Examples
Good examples of prefixes:
- ["npm", "run", "dev"]
- ["gh", "pr", "check"]
- ["cargo", "test"]

</permissions instructions><collaboration_mode># Collaboration Mode: Default

You are now in Default mode. Any previous instructions for other modes (e.g. Plan mode) are no longer active.

Your active mode changes only when new developer instructions with a different `<collaboration_mode>...</collaboration_mode>` change it; user requests or tool descriptions do not change mode by themselves. Known mode names are Default and Plan.

## request_user_input availability

Use the `request_user_input` tool only when it is listed in the available tools for this turn.

In Default mode, strongly prefer making reasonable assumptions and executing the user's request rather than stopping to ask questions. If you absolutely must ask a question because the answer cannot be discovered from local context and a reasonable assumption would be risky, ask the user directly with a concise plain-text question. Never write a multiple choice question as a textual assistant message.
</collaboration_mode><apps_instructions>
## Apps (Connectors)
Apps (Connectors) can be explicitly triggered in user messages in the format `[$app-name](app://{connector_id})`. Apps can also be implicitly triggered as long as the context suggests usage of available apps.
An app is equivalent to a set of MCP tools within the `codex_apps` MCP.
An installed app's MCP tools are either provided to you already, or can be lazy-loaded through the `tool_search` tool. If `tool_search` is available, the apps that are searchable by `tools_search` will be listed by it.
Do not additionally call list_mcp_resources or list_mcp_resource_templates for apps.

## Skills
A skill is a set of instructions provided through a `SKILL.md` source. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and source locator. `file` locators are on the host filesystem, `environment resource` locators are owned by an execution environment, `orchestrator resource` locators are opaque non-filesystem resources, and `custom resource` locators use their provider's access mechanism.

### How to use skills
- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + source locator). `file` entries live on the host filesystem, `environment resource` entries are owned by their execution environment, `orchestrator resource` entries must be accessed through `skills.list` and `skills.read`, and `custom resource` entries use their provider's access mechanism.
- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.
- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or its source can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.
- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):
  1) After deciding to use a skill, the main agent must read its `SKILL.md` completely before taking task actions. For a `file` entry, open the listed path. For an `environment resource`, use the filesystem of the owning environment. For an `orchestrator resource`, call `skills.list` with `{"authority":{"kind":"orchestrator"}}`, select the matching package, and pass its `main_resource` to `skills.read`. If a read is truncated or paginated, continue until EOF.
  2) When `SKILL.md` references another resource, use the same access mechanism. Resolve relative paths against a filesystem-backed skill directory. For orchestrator skills, pass the exact referenced resource identifier with the same authority and package to `skills.read`; do not treat `skill://` identifiers as filesystem paths.
  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, use its routing instructions to identify the resources required for the task. The main agent must read each required instruction or reference file itself before acting on it. Do not delegate reading, summarizing, or interpreting skill instructions to a subagent. Subagents may still perform task work when the selected skill allows it.
  4) For filesystem-backed skills, prefer running or patching provided scripts instead of retyping large code blocks. For orchestrator skills, use `skills.read` and the available tools; do not invent a local path.
  5) Reuse provided assets or templates through the same source access mechanism instead of recreating them.
- Coordination and sequencing:
  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.
  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.
- Context hygiene:
  - Progressive disclosure applies to selecting relevant files, not partially reading a selected instruction file. Do not load unrelated references, scripts, or assets.
  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.
  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.
- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.
</skills_instructions><plugins_instructions>
## Plugins
A plugin is a local bundle of skills, MCP servers, and apps.
### How to use plugins
- Skill naming: If a plugin contributes skills, those skill entries are prefixed with `plugin_name:` in the Skills list.
- MCP naming: Plugin-provided MCP tools keep standard MCP identifiers such as `mcp__server__tool`; use tool provenance to tell which plugin they come from.
- Trigger rules: If the user explicitly names a plugin, prefer capabilities associated with that plugin for that turn.
- Relationship to capabilities: Plugins are not invoked directly. Use their underlying skills, MCP tools, and app tools to help solve the task.
- Relevance: Determine what a plugin can help with from explicit user mention or from the plugin-associated skills, MCP tools, and apps exposed elsewhere in this turn.
- Missing/blocked: If the user requests a plugin that does not have relevant callable capabilities for the task, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.
</plugins_instructions>## Memory

You have access to a memory folder with guidance from prior runs. It can save
time and help you stay consistent. Use it whenever it is likely to help.

Decision boundary: should you use memory for a new user query?

- Skip memory ONLY when the request is clearly self-contained and does not need
  workspace history, conventions, or prior decisions.
- Hard skip examples: current time/date, simple translation, simple sentence
  rewrite, one-line shell command, trivial formatting.
- Use memory by default when ANY of these are true:
  - the query mentions workspace/repo/module/path/files in MEMORY_SUMMARY below,
  - the user asks for prior context / consistency / previous decisions,
  - the task is ambiguous and could depend on earlier project choices,
  - the ask is a non-trivial and related to MEMORY_SUMMARY below.
- If unsure, do a quick memory pass.

Memory layout (general -> specific):

- C:\Users\izzuddin\.codex\memories/memory_summary.md (already provided below; do NOT open again)
- C:\Users\izzuddin\.codex\memories/MEMORY.md (searchable registry; primary file to query)
- C:\Users\izzuddin\.codex\memories/skills/<skill-name>/ (skill folder)
  - SKILL.md (entrypoint instructions)
  - scripts/ (optional helper scripts)
  - examples/ (optional example outputs)
  - templates/ (optional templates)
- C:\Users\izzuddin\.codex\memories/rollout_summaries/ (per-rollout recaps + evidence snippets)
  - The paths of these entries can be found in C:\Users\izzuddin\.codex\memories/MEMORY.md or C:\Users\izzuddin\.codex\memories/rollout_summaries/ as `rollout_path`
  - These files are append-only `jsonl`: `session_meta.payload.id` identifies the session, `turn_context` marks turn boundaries, `event_msg` is the lightweight status stream, and `response_item` contains actual messages, tool calls, and tool outputs.
  - For efficient lookup, prefer matching the filename suffix or `session_meta.payload.id`; avoid broad full-content scans unless needed.

Quick memory pass (when applicable):

1. Skim the MEMORY_SUMMARY below and extract task-relevant keywords.
2. Search C:\Users\izzuddin\.codex\memories/MEMORY.md using those keywords.
3. Only if MEMORY.md directly points to rollout summaries/skills, open the 1-2
   most relevant files under C:\Users\izzuddin\.codex\memories/rollout_summaries/ or
   C:\Users\izzuddin\.codex\memories/skills/.
4. If above are not clear and you need exact commands, error text, or precise evidence, search over `rollout_path` for more evidence.
5. If there are no relevant hits, stop memory lookup and continue normally.

Quick-pass budget:

- Keep memory lookup lightweight: ideally <= 4-6 search steps before main work.
- Avoid broad scans of all rollout summaries.

During execution: if you hit repeated errors, confusing behavior, or suspect
relevant prior context, redo the quick memory pass.

How to decide whether to verify memory:

- Consider both risk of drift and verification effort.
- If a fact is likely to drift and is cheap to verify, verify it before
  answering.
- If a fact is likely to drift but verification is expensive, slow, or
  disruptive, it is acceptable to answer from memory in an interactive turn,
  but you should say that it is memory-derived, note that it may be stale, and
  consider offering to refresh it live.
- If a fact is lower-drift and expensive to verify, it is usually fine to
  answer from memory directly.

When answering from memory without current verification:

- If you rely on memory for a fact that you did not verify in the current turn,
  say so briefly in the final answer.
- If that fact is plausibly drift-prone or comes from an older note, older
  snapshot, or prior run summary, say that it may be stale or outdated.
- If live verification was skipped and a refresh would be useful in the
  interactive context, consider offering to verify or refresh it live.
- Do not present unverified memory-derived facts as confirmed-current.
- Prefer a short refresh offer for interactive questions, especially about prior
  results, commands, timing, or older snapshots.

Memory citation requirements:

- If ANY relevant memory files were used: append exactly one
`<oai-mem-citation>` block as the VERY LAST content of the final reply.
  Normal responses should include the answer first, then append the
`<oai-mem-citation>` block at the end.
- Use this exact structure for programmatic parsing:
```
<oai-mem-citation>
<citation_entries>
MEMORY.md:234-236|note=[responsesapi citation extraction code pointer]
rollout_summaries/2026-02-17T21-23-02-LN3m-example.md:10-12|note=[weekly report format]
</citation_entries>
<rollout_ids>
019c6e27-e55b-73d1-87d8-4e01f1f75043
019c7714-3b77-74d1-9866-e1f484aae2ab
</rollout_ids>
</oai-mem-citation>
```
- `citation_entries` is for rendering:
  - one citation entry per line
  - format: `<file>:<line_start>-<line_end>|note=[<how memory was used>]`
  - use file paths relative to the memory base path (for example, `MEMORY.md`,
    `rollout_summaries/...`, `skills/...`)
  - only cite files actually used under the memory base path (do not cite
    workspace files as memory citations)
  - if you used `MEMORY.md` and then a rollout summary/skill file, cite both
  - list entries in order of importance (most important first)
  - `note` should be short, single-line, and use simple characters only (avoid
    unusual symbols, no newlines)
- `rollout_ids` is for us to track what previous rollouts you find useful:
  - include one rollout id per line
  - rollout ids should look like UUIDs (for example,
    `019c6e27-e55b-73d1-87d8-4e01f1f75043`)
  - include unique ids only; do not repeat ids
  - an empty `<rollout_ids>` section is allowed if no rollout ids are available
  - you can find rollout ids in rollout summary files and MEMORY.md
  - do not include file paths or notes in this section
  - For every `citation_entries`, try to find and cite the corresponding rollout id if possible
- Never include memory citations inside pull-request messages.
- Never cite blank lines; double-check ranges.

Updating memories:

You can update the memories **only** when explicitly asked by the user. This must always come from a direct request from the user.
- Write your update in C:\Users\izzuddin\.codex\memories/extensions/ad_hoc/notes/
- Each update must be one small file containing what you want to add/delete/update from the memories.
- The name of this file must be `<timestamp>-<short slug>.md`
- Do not try to edit the memory files yourself, only add one update note in C:\Users\izzuddin\.codex\memories/extensions/ad_hoc/notes/

## User Profile

The user works in local Windows folders and uses Codex for hands-on engineering help, especially code review and OCR-related systems. They give explicit operating boundaries and expect those to be followed literally, such as "dont modify anything" or "do not make assumptions." When asking for reviews, they want senior-level output: concrete bugs, performance and security issues, rewrite guidance, and explanations of why a change would help. Their current memory set centers on artifact-heavy OCR projects with Python/FastAPI backends and, in one case, a React/Vite frontend. Good collaboration means starting from the main code paths, being honest about what was only inferred from source, and not pretending a reconnaissance pass is a completed review.

## User preferences

- When the user says "dont modify anything" or "dont change anything in the code first", default to a read-only analysis/review pass and do not patch files unless they later authorize edits.
- When the user asks to "Act as a senior code reviewer", "Find bugs", "Find performance issues", or "Find security issues", prioritize concrete defects, severity, and remediation guidance over general commentary.
- When the user also asks to "Rewrite the code using best practices" and "Explain every change" during a no-edit review, provide suggested rewrites plus rationale, but keep them advisory until editing is approved.
- When the user says "Ask questions if information is missing" and "Do not make assumptions", surface uncertainty explicitly instead of filling gaps with guesses.

## General Tips

- Environment signal in memory: Windows folders, often outside git repositories, so check repo status once and fall back to direct file inspection if `git` is unavailable.
- In artifact-heavy OCR/ML projects, route the first review pass into entry points, server wiring, pipeline modules, and main frontend containers before reading datasets, debug outputs, caches, or model artifacts.
- For OCR systems, inspect Unicode normalization and text-parsing heuristics directly; mojibake and broad regex/substring rules can hide high-impact bugs.
- Keep source-based review findings separate from runtime-confirmed behavior; use non-mutating verification like lint, typecheck, or compile checks when available.
- Related reusable procedure: `skills/read-only-code-review/SKILL.md`.

## What's in Memory

### C:\Users\izzuddin\Desktop\OCR Balloon System

#### 2026-06-18

- Read-only FastAPI + React OCR app review: FastAPI, React, Vite, YOLO, PaddleOCR, frontend/src/App.tsx, backend/app/main.py, npm run lint, npx tsc, python -m compileall
  - desc: Search here first for senior review output on the OCR Balloon System when the user wants bugs, security/performance issues, and rewrite guidance without edits; applies to `cwd=C:\Users\izzuddin\Desktop\OCR Balloon System`.
  - learnings: Main findings include localhost-only frontend URLs, cwd-fragile model loading, permissive CORS, cache growth, unguarded PDF/image decoding, response-shape drift, and Excel export not reflecting browser-side edits.

### C:\Users\izzuddin\Desktop\OCR DRAWING

#### 2026-06-16

- Read-only OCR pipeline review setup: OCR DRAWING, code/main.py, webapp/server.py, pdf2image, paddleocr, ultralytics, google-genai, not a git repository
  - desc: Search here first for reconnaissance on the OCR DRAWING project before a full review; applies to `cwd=C:\Users\izzuddin\Desktop\OCR DRAWING` and mainly maps the important code surfaces plus review boundaries.
  - learnings: Treat this as setup only, not final findings; start with `code/` and `webapp/`, and avoid assuming git metadata exists.

### Older Memory Topics

No older topics are currently retained beyond the recent OCR review window.

**User**

scan the whole system

---


**OpenAI Codex**

I’ll treat “scan the whole system” as a read-only project reconnaissance and health review: map the folders, identify main entry points, inspect risky code paths, and report concrete issues without modifying files. I’ll first check the saved project notes so I don’t repeat old blind spots.

---


**OpenAI Codex**

The prior note says this repo was only reconnaissance before, not a completed review. I’m going to scan current files from the main code surfaces outward and keep findings separated from anything I only infer.

---


**OpenAI Codex**

I confirmed the current folder has a `.git` directory but `git status` fails, so I won’t rely on Git metadata. Next I’m reading the core Python and web files with line numbers so the report can point to exact evidence.

---


**OpenAI Codex**

The code surface is bigger than a small script now: the main ballooning module is about 108 KB, and the web API is separate. I’m narrowing on execution paths that can break production use: upload handling, background jobs, OCR/model loading, file paths, Excel/PDF exports, and broad exception handling.

---


**OpenAI Codex**

A few high-risk patterns already show in source: permissive CORS, in-memory job state, no upload size limit, and generated files served directly. I’m checking whether those are isolated development choices or real system-level problems by following the downstream processing and export code.

---


**OpenAI Codex**

I’m going to run a syntax-only scan using Python AST parsing with bytecode disabled, so it checks all `.py` files without creating or changing project files. Then I’ll inspect any logs already present for runtime evidence.

---


**OpenAI Codex**

The runtime logs contain a serious security finding: an old Gemini API key appears in plaintext inside `logs/process.log`. I won’t repeat the key back, but it should be treated as exposed and revoked if it was ever valid.

---


**OpenAI Codex**

The scan found another concrete deployment issue: `requirements.txt` does not list every imported dependency. That means a clean machine can install requirements successfully but still crash when it reaches `pydantic`, `tenacity`, or `fitz`/PyMuPDF paths.

---


**OpenAI Codex**

I have enough evidence for a first system scan now: structure, syntax, core paths, logs, and main risk areas. I’ll summarize it clearly as current findings, with file and line references, and I won’t claim runtime behavior beyond what the logs/source prove.

---


**OpenAI Codex**

**Problem**  
I scanned the OCR DRAWING system read-only. No files were modified. The system is a FastAPI web app plus Python OCR/YOLO/PaddleOCR/Gemini pipeline, with many generated job artifacts already stored.

**Analysis**  
Main risk findings:

1. **Critical: API key leaked in logs**  
   [logs/process.log](/c:/Users/izzuddin/Desktop/OCR%20DRAWING/logs/process.log:65) contains a plaintext Gemini API key inside an old error response. Treat it as exposed: revoke it, create a new key, and clean/redact logs.

2. **High: uploads are not safely limited or validated**  
   [webapp/server.py](/c:/Users/izzuddin/Desktop/OCR%20DRAWING/webapp/server.py:191) only checks `.pdf` extension, then saves the whole file with `copyfileobj` at line 203/241. A bad or huge PDF can consume disk/RAM/CPU during `pdf2image`.

3. **High: generated files are publicly served**  
   [webapp/server.py](/c:/Users/izzuddin/Desktop/OCR%20DRAWING/webapp/server.py:50) mounts all `generated_jobs` under `/generated`. Uploaded PDFs, extracted Excel, debug title-block OCR text, and output images become directly reachable if someone knows/guesses the URL.

4. **High: `job_id` is trusted from client input**  
   [webapp/server.py](/c:/Users/izzuddin/Desktop/OCR%20DRAWING/webapp/server.py:67), [line 274](/c:/Users/izzuddin/Desktop/OCR%20DRAWING/webapp/server.py:274), and [line 301](/c:/Users/izzuddin/Desktop/OCR%20DRAWING/webapp/server.py:301) build paths from user-provided `job_id` without strict validation/resolution checks. This is a path traversal risk.

5. **Medium: clean install can fail because requirements are incomplete**  
   [requirements.txt](/c:/Users/izzuddin/Desktop/OCR%20DRAWING/requirements.txt:1) does not include `pydantic`, `tenacity`, or `PyMuPDF`, but they are imported in [ai_parser.py](/c:/Users/izzuddin/Desktop/OCR%20DRAWING/code/ai_parser.py:5) and [auto_ballooning.py](/c:/Users/izzuddin/Desktop/OCR%20DRAWING/code/auto_ballooning.py:10).

6. **Medium: cache can process the wrong drawing**  
   [auto_ballooning.py](/c:/Users/izzuddin/Desktop/OCR%20DRAWING/code/auto_ballooning.py:2774) defaults `use_cache=True`; [line 2792](/c:/Users/izzuddin/Desktop/OCR%20DRAWING/code/auto_ballooning.py:2792) may reuse an existing cached image based on filename instead of the uploaded PDF content. Same filename, different drawing = wrong result.

7. **Medium: job status is only in memory**  
   [webapp/server.py](/c:/Users/izzuddin/Desktop/OCR%20DRAWING/webapp/server.py:52) uses `JOB_STATUS = {}`. Restarting the server loses job states; multiple workers will also disagree.

8. **Runtime evidence: port conflict happened**  
   [webapp/storage/uvicorn.err.log](/c:/Users/izzuddin/Desktop/OCR%20DRAWING/webapp/storage/uvicorn.err.log:4) shows port `127.0.0.1:8001` was already in use.

**Solution**  
First fixes I recommend, in order:

1. Revoke leaked Gemini key and delete/redact old logs.
2. Add upload size limit, MIME/content validation, and PDF page limits.
3. Stop serving all generated files publicly; use authenticated/download endpoints per job.
4. Validate `job_id` with a strict regex like `^[a-f0-9]{12}$` and resolve paths under `JOBS_DIR`.
5. Update `requirements.txt` with missing dependencies.
6. Disable cache for uploaded web jobs, or key cache by file hash.
7. Move job status to disk/SQLite if this app must survive restarts.

**Steps Run**  
I checked folder structure, main code paths, risky patterns, existing logs, and parsed all Python files with AST. Syntax scan result: `23` Python files checked, `0` syntax errors.

**OpenAI Codex**

<permissions instructions>
Filesystem sandboxing defines which files can be read or written. `sandbox_mode` is `workspace-write`: The sandbox permits reading files, and editing files in `cwd` and `writable_roots`. Editing files in other directories requires approval. Network access is restricted.
# Escalation Requests

Commands are run outside the sandbox if they are approved by the user, or match an existing rule that allows it to run unrestricted. The command string is split into independent command segments at shell control operators, including but not limited to:

- Pipes: |
- Logical operators: &&, ||
- Command separators: ;
- Subshell boundaries: (...), $(...)

Each resulting segment is evaluated independently for sandbox restrictions and approval requirements.

Example:

git pull | tee output.txt

This is treated as two command segments:

["git", "pull"]

["tee", "output.txt"]

Commands that use more advanced shell features like redirection (>, >>, <), substitutions ($(...), ...), environment variables (FOO=bar), or wildcard patterns (*, ?) will not be evaluated against rules, to limit the scope of what an approved rule allows.

## How to request escalation

IMPORTANT: To request approval to execute a command that will require escalated privileges:

- Provide the `sandbox_permissions` parameter with the value `"require_escalated"`
- Include a short question asking the user if they want to allow the action in `justification` parameter. e.g. "Do you want to download and install dependencies for this project?"
- Optionally suggest a `prefix_rule` - this will be shown to the user with an option to persist the rule approval for future sessions.

If you run a command that is important to solving the user's query, but it fails because of sandboxing or with a likely sandbox-related network error (for example DNS/host resolution, registry/index access, or dependency download failure), rerun the command with "require_escalated". ALWAYS proceed to use the `justification` parameter - do not message the user before requesting approval for the command.

## When to request escalation

While commands are running inside the sandbox, here are some scenarios that will require escalation outside the sandbox:

- You need to run a command that writes to a directory that requires it (e.g. running tests that write to /var)
- You need to run a GUI app (e.g., open/xdg-open/osascript) to open browsers or files.
- If you run a command that is important to solving the user's query, but it fails because of sandboxing or with a likely sandbox-related network error (for example DNS/host resolution, registry/index access, or dependency download failure), rerun the command with `require_escalated`. ALWAYS proceed to use the `sandbox_permissions` and `justification` parameters. do not message the user before requesting approval for the command.
- You are about to take a potentially destructive action such as an `rm` or `git reset` that the user did not explicitly ask for.
- Be judicious with escalating, but if completing the user's request requires it, you should do so - don't try and circumvent approvals by using other tools.

## prefix_rule guidance

When choosing a `prefix_rule`, request one that will allow you to fulfill similar requests from the user in the future without re-requesting escalation. It should be categorical and reasonably scoped to similar capabilities. You should rarely pass the entire command into `prefix_rule`.

### Banned prefix_rules 
Avoid requesting overly broad prefixes that the user would be ill-advised to approve. For example, do not request ["python3"], ["python", "-"], or other similar prefixes that would allow arbitrary scripting.
NEVER provide a prefix_rule argument for destructive commands like rm.
NEVER provide a prefix_rule if your command uses a heredoc or herestring. 

### Examples
Good examples of prefixes:
- ["npm", "run", "dev"]
- ["gh", "pr", "check"]
- ["cargo", "test"]


## Approved command prefixes
The following prefix rules have already been approved: - ["Test-Path"]

**User**

what is this system is and what is the workflow and how the system works

---


**OpenAI Codex**

**Problem**  
You want to understand what this OCR DRAWING system is, what workflow it follows, and how it works.

**Analysis**  
This system is an **AI/OCR engineering drawing inspection tool**. In simple words: you upload or process a PDF drawing, the system reads the drawing, detects dimensions/symbols, adds balloon numbers, and creates inspection report files.

Main purpose:

- Read engineering drawing PDFs.
- Extract title block info like drawing number, revision, material, part name.
- Detect measurement text like diameter, radius, tolerance, holes, threads, GD&T.
- Detect engineering symbols using YOLO.
- Generate ballooned drawing image/PDF.
- Generate FA inspection Excel report.

**Main Parts**  
The system has two main modes:

1. **Web App Mode**  
   Main file: [webapp/server.py](/c:/Users/izzuddin/Desktop/OCR%20DRAWING/webapp/server.py:184)

   User opens the web page, uploads a PDF, waits for processing, reviews extracted rows, edits if needed, then downloads Excel or corrected PDF.

2. **Command Line / Batch Mode**  
   Main file: [code/main.py](/c:/Users/izzuddin/Desktop/OCR%20DRAWING/code/main.py:66)

   This processes drawings from folders and exports title block / OCR results.

The main full pipeline is in: [auto_ballooning.py](/c:/Users/izzuddin/Desktop/OCR%20DRAWING/code/auto_ballooning.py:2774)

**Workflow**  
The web workflow is:

1. User uploads PDF from browser.
2. FastAPI saves the file into a job folder.
3. System converts the first PDF page into an image.
4. System reads title block using OCR.
5. System detects symbols using YOLO.
6. System extracts measurements from PDF text layer and OCR.
7. System filters, classifies, and removes duplicate measurement rows.
8. System builds FA inspection rows.
9. System draws balloon numbers on the drawing.
10. System exports:
   - ballooned PNG
   - ballooned PDF
   - FA Excel report
   - measurement result Excel
   - rejected candidate Excel
   - symbol detection Excel

**How It Works**  
At the center, `process_single_drawing()` controls the full job:

[auto_ballooning.py](/c:/Users/izzuddin/Desktop/OCR%20DRAWING/code/auto_ballooning.py:2774)

It does this:

```text
PDF
 -> image
 -> title block OCR
 -> YOLO symbol detection
 -> PDF text extraction
 -> PaddleOCR measurement extraction
 -> measurement cleanup
 -> FA row creation
 -> balloon drawing
 -> Excel/PDF output
```

The web server calls this through:

[api_bridge.py](/c:/Users/izzuddin/Desktop/OCR%20DRAWING/code/api_bridge.py:9)

The browser talks to the backend through:

[app.js](/c:/Users/izzuddin/Desktop/OCR%20DRAWING/webapp/static/app.js:41)

**Important Flow In Simple Words**  
Example:

You upload `W3-C111260501-01.pdf`.

The system creates a job folder like:

```text
generated_jobs/jobs/<job_id>/
```

Inside that folder, it saves:

```text
upload/original PDF
original.png
ballooned.png
ballooned.pdf
fa_inspection_report.xlsx
measurement_results.xlsx
rejected_candidates.xlsx
symbol_detections.xlsx
```

Then the web page shows the ballooned drawing and extracted table for review.

**Solution / Summary**  
This is not just an OCR script. It is a complete drawing inspection assistant:

- **Frontend:** upload/review/download UI.
- **Backend:** FastAPI server.
- **OCR Engine:** PaddleOCR.
- **Object Detection:** YOLO models.
- **PDF Tools:** pdf2image and PyMuPDF.
- **Report Output:** Excel and PDF generation.

The system works by turning the drawing into data, then turning that data back into a ballooned drawing and inspection report.

<permissions instructions>
Filesystem sandboxing defines which files can be read or written. `sandbox_mode` is `workspace-write`: The sandbox permits reading files, and editing files in `cwd` and `writable_roots`. Editing files in other directories requires approval. Network access is restricted.
# Escalation Requests

Commands are run outside the sandbox if they are approved by the user, or match an existing rule that allows it to run unrestricted. The command string is split into independent command segments at shell control operators, including but not limited to:

- Pipes: |
- Logical operators: &&, ||
- Command separators: ;
- Subshell boundaries: (...), $(...)

Each resulting segment is evaluated independently for sandbox restrictions and approval requirements.

Example:

git pull | tee output.txt

This is treated as two command segments:

["git", "pull"]

["tee", "output.txt"]

Commands that use more advanced shell features like redirection (>, >>, <), substitutions ($(...), ...), environment variables (FOO=bar), or wildcard patterns (*, ?) will not be evaluated against rules, to limit the scope of what an approved rule allows.

## How to request escalation

IMPORTANT: To request approval to execute a command that will require escalated privileges:

- Provide the `sandbox_permissions` parameter with the value `"require_escalated"`
- Include a short question asking the user if they want to allow the action in `justification` parameter. e.g. "Do you want to download and install dependencies for this project?"
- Optionally suggest a `prefix_rule` - this will be shown to the user with an option to persist the rule approval for future sessions.

If you run a command that is important to solving the user's query, but it fails because of sandboxing or with a likely sandbox-related network error (for example DNS/host resolution, registry/index access, or dependency download failure), rerun the command with "require_escalated". ALWAYS proceed to use the `justification` parameter - do not message the user before requesting approval for the command.

## When to request escalation

While commands are running inside the sandbox, here are some scenarios that will require escalation outside the sandbox:

- You need to run a command that writes to a directory that requires it (e.g. running tests that write to /var)
- You need to run a GUI app (e.g., open/xdg-open/osascript) to open browsers or files.
- If you run a command that is important to solving the user's query, but it fails because of sandboxing or with a likely sandbox-related network error (for example DNS/host resolution, registry/index access, or dependency download failure), rerun the command with `require_escalated`. ALWAYS proceed to use the `sandbox_permissions` and `justification` parameters. do not message the user before requesting approval for the command.
- You are about to take a potentially destructive action such as an `rm` or `git reset` that the user did not explicitly ask for.
- Be judicious with escalating, but if completing the user's request requires it, you should do so - don't try and circumvent approvals by using other tools.

## prefix_rule guidance

When choosing a `prefix_rule`, request one that will allow you to fulfill similar requests from the user in the future without re-requesting escalation. It should be categorical and reasonably scoped to similar capabilities. You should rarely pass the entire command into `prefix_rule`.

### Banned prefix_rules 
Avoid requesting overly broad prefixes that the user would be ill-advised to approve. For example, do not request ["python3"], ["python", "-"], or other similar prefixes that would allow arbitrary scripting.
NEVER provide a prefix_rule argument for destructive commands like rm.
NEVER provide a prefix_rule if your command uses a heredoc or herestring. 

### Examples
Good examples of prefixes:
- ["npm", "run", "dev"]
- ["gh", "pr", "check"]
- ["cargo", "test"]


## Approved command prefixes
The following prefix rules have already been approved: - ["Test-Path"]
- ["npm", "install"]

**User**

these are the results and theres a lot of errors, wrong balloons and miss balloons dimensions. fix it and i want to know which trained dataset you use?

---


**OpenAI Codex**

I’ll treat this as a concrete accuracy/debug task now: inspect the failed output files, trace which model weights/datasets the pipeline is using, then patch the extraction/ballooning logic where the evidence points. I’ll keep the checks grounded in the actual PDF, Excel, generated PDF, and code paths.

---


**OpenAI Codex**

The three files are accessible. Next I’m going to compare the downloaded Excel/PDF with the current pipeline outputs and list the exact model weight files plus their training metadata, so we know whether the errors come from OCR logic, YOLO model choice, cached data, or report/balloon placement.

---


**OpenAI Codex**

The active symbol model is not `yolo_symbols_v4`; by config order it will use `runs/detect/runs/symbols_training/yolo_symbols/weights/best.pt` first when present, trained from Roboflow engineering-symbol-detection dataset version 6. I’m now reading the failed Excel rows and the job output that matches your downloaded result.

---


**OpenAI Codex**

The failed report has 94 inspection rows, and the symbol detector only found 9 symbol boxes. That mismatch explains part of the “wrong/missing balloons”: many rows are coming from OCR/PDF text extraction, not from reliable symbol detection, so row coordinates and grouping become fragile.

---


**OpenAI Codex**

The current output has clear data-quality bugs, not just model misses: example, `2 x M4 Helicoil 2D (SUS)` is split into `2xM / 4` and `M / 4`, and `2XR0.3以下` becomes bad duplicate rows. I’m tracing the row-building and balloon drawing code now, then I’ll make focused fixes.

---


**OpenAI Codex**

One concrete root cause is now confirmed: the web bridge calls `process_single_drawing(..., use_cache=True)`, so this uploaded PDF can reuse old cached image/measurement rows from `dataset/images` and `measurement_detection_results.xlsx`. For accuracy fixes, web uploads should process the actual file, not stale training/sample cache.

---


**OpenAI Codex**

I started a no-cache run for the same drawing. It is still processing, which is expected because PaddleOCR/YOLO on a full engineering drawing is slow; I’ll compare its rows against the downloaded result when it finishes.

---


**OpenAI Codex**

The no-cache run is using PaddleOCR’s local model loader and has begun OCR work. I’m letting it complete because this comparison is important: if no-cache improves the rows, the first fix is definitely to stop web uploads from using cached sample measurements.

---


**OpenAI Codex**

Still running. While it works, I’m going to patch the proven low-risk issue first: web uploads should not reuse cached dataset OCR rows, because that can directly cause wrong/missing balloons for a newly uploaded PDF.

---


**OpenAI Codex**

I’m editing only the bridge setting now. This keeps command-line batch behavior unchanged, but makes the web result use the uploaded PDF content instead of old cached measurement workbooks.

---


**OpenAI Codex**

The no-cache run confirms the PDF is rendered very large and PaddleOCR is resizing internally. That can affect small dimension OCR, so after this I’ll also tighten report filtering around OCR fragments and multiplier formatting rather than only changing the cache setting.

---


**OpenAI Codex**

Still processing; no crash so far. The slow part is full-page OCR plus local rescue crops. I’ll keep the session alive until it returns so we don’t leave a background command hanging.

---


**OpenAI Codex**

This run is taking several minutes, which itself is useful evidence: full no-cache processing is heavier but more correct for uploads. I’m going to let it finish, then I’ll decide if we need performance guards or OCR image-size tuning in addition to the accuracy fixes.

---


**OpenAI Codex**

It’s still alive and quiet. I’m watching it rather than killing it because stopping midway would leave us without the key before/after comparison.

---


**OpenAI Codex**

This is now clearly a performance concern: one drawing no-cache has been running for a while. I’ll still wait for completion, but this points to a second fix area after accuracy: avoiding repeated OCR model calls/crops where possible.

---


**OpenAI Codex**

The no-cache verification run is taking too long for an interactive fix pass. I’m going to stop that check cleanly and continue with source-level fixes proven by the existing output: stale cache use, multiplier display, and OCR fragment handling.

---


**OpenAI Codex**

The session backend cannot send Ctrl+C here, so I’m going to identify the Python process for this specific `auto_ballooning.py` run and stop only that process. This avoids leaving a long OCR job running in the background.

---


**OpenAI Codex**

Approved command prefix saved:
- ["C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe", "-Command", "Get-CimInstance Win32_Process | Where-Object { $_.Name -eq 'python.exe' -and $_.CommandLine -like '*auto_ballooning.py*fab_c3060_no_cache_check*' } | Select-Object ProcessId,CommandLine"]

---


**OpenAI Codex**

Approved command prefix saved:
- ["Stop-Process", "-Id", "18696", "-Force"]

---


**OpenAI Codex**

I’m making two more focused fixes: clean multiplier symbols in the FA report so rows show `M`, `R`, `C` instead of `2xM/2xR/2xC`, and reject incomplete OCR values like `R0.` that currently become false `R 0` balloons.

---


**OpenAI Codex**

The first patch hit the file’s mojibake/unicode text awkwardly, so I’m applying the edits in smaller chunks around exact local context.

---


**OpenAI Codex**

I found the exact stored text: the file contains a real `Ø` character there, while the console showed mojibake. Applying with that exact content now.

---


**OpenAI Codex**

The multiplier export change is in. It leaves the balloon quantity display intact, but prevents the Excel symbol column from carrying the quantity prefix on only the first sub-row.

---


**OpenAI Codex**

There’s one unused line left from the old multiplier formatting. I’m removing it with narrower context because the symbol text includes mixed encoding.

---


**OpenAI Codex**

Now I’m adding a small guard for incomplete symbol dimensions. This targets cases like `R0.` or `C0.` where OCR cut off the decimal, which should be rejected for review instead of ballooned as a real zero-size feature.

---


**OpenAI Codex**

I’ve patched the report-building logic. Next I’m doing a syntax check and a fast rebuild from the existing job’s measurement workbook so we can verify the obvious false rows are removed without rerunning the slow OCR step.

---


**OpenAI Codex**

Syntax passed. The fast workbook rebuild is still running, probably importing OCR/model modules even though it is only rebuilding rows; I’ll wait for that process to finish and then inspect the result.

---


**OpenAI Codex**

The verification rebuild succeeded. The obvious `R 0` false rows are now gone, and multiplier rows now show clean symbols like `M / 4`, `R / 0.3`, instead of `2xM / 4` on the first row.

---


**OpenAI Codex**

The rebuilt workbook now shows the first rows correctly as `M / 4`, `R / 0.3`, etc. One note: the full no-cache OCR run was stopped because it ran too long; the fix is validated against the existing failed job’s measurement data, not a complete fresh OCR pass.

---


**OpenAI Codex**

I’m also generating corrected output files from the failed job data, so you have something concrete to open: a rebuilt FA Excel and ballooned PDF under `test_outputs`. This uses the existing OCR results plus the patched row/report logic.

---


**OpenAI Codex**

**Problem**  
Your result files had wrong balloon labels and bad/missing dimension rows for `FAB-C-3060-010-9100 W3-C100807301-00.pdf`.

**Analysis**  
I found 3 concrete causes:

1. Web uploads were using cached OCR/sample rows:  
   [api_bridge.py](/c:/Users/izzuddin/Desktop/OCR%20DRAWING/code/api_bridge.py:19) was using `use_cache=True`. That can reuse old `dataset/images` and `measurement_detection_results.xlsx` data, causing wrong balloons for uploaded PDFs.

2. Multiplier symbols were exported wrongly:  
   Example: `2 x M4` became `2xM / 4` on first row and `M / 4` on second row. This made the FA report confusing.

3. Incomplete OCR decimals became false balloons:  
   Example: OCR like `R0.` became `R / 0`, which is not a valid dimension.

**Solution Applied**  
I changed:

- [api_bridge.py](/c:/Users/izzuddin/Desktop/OCR%20DRAWING/code/api_bridge.py:19)  
  Web uploads now use `use_cache=False`, so future uploads process the actual PDF instead of old cached rows.

- [auto_ballooning.py](/c:/Users/izzuddin/Desktop/OCR%20DRAWING/code/auto_ballooning.py:239)  
  Multiplier rows now keep clean symbols like `M`, `R`, `C`.

- [auto_ballooning.py](/c:/Users/izzuddin/Desktop/OCR%20DRAWING/code/auto_ballooning.py:1179)  
  Added rejection for incomplete symbol/decimal OCR like `R0.`.

**Fixed Output Generated**  
I generated corrected output here:

- [FA_Inspection_Report_after_fix.xlsx](/c:/Users/izzuddin/Desktop/OCR%20DRAWING/test_outputs/fab_c3060_after_fix/FA_Inspection_Report_after_fix.xlsx)
- [Ballooned_Drawing_after_fix.pdf](/c:/Users/izzuddin/Desktop/OCR%20DRAWING/test_outputs/fab_c3060_after_fix/Ballooned_Drawing_after_fix.pdf)

Verification: syntax check passed, and rebuilt output has no `R 0` false rows. The multiplier rows now show clean symbols like `M / 4` and `R / 0.3`.

**Dataset Used**  
For symbols, the active model is:

`runs/detect/runs/symbols_training/yolo_symbols/weights/best.pt`

It was trained using:

`dataset/yolo_symbols/data.yaml`

That dataset is Roboflow:

`engineering-symbol-detection`, version `6`, with `20` classes.

For title block detection, the model is:

`runs/detect/runs/titleblock/yolo_titleblock/weights/best.pt`

trained on:

`dataset/yolo_titleblock/data.yaml`

Important note: `dataset/yolo_symbols_v4` also exists, but it is not the first active model. The config tries `yolo_symbols` first.

**Remaining Risk**  
This improves the proven errors, but it may not catch every missed dimension. Missing balloons usually need better OCR tuning or retraining/labeling more examples for this exact drawing style.
